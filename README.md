# Scoreboard
ӨЗБЛАС Онооны самбар

I’m going to show you how I built a scoreboard back in 2019 (when I was 17 years old); featuring a bluetooth controller, bright lights, and a super loud horn. I'll also show you all the parts needed and briefly explain how I built it, in case you want to make one yourself.

In 11th grade, I got the idea to make my own scoreboard. Presented to my highschool, so then they funded us to build scoreboard.
