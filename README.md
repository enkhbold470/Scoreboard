## Scoreboard
## ӨЗБЛАС Онооны самбар

I am thrilled to share you how I built a scoreboard back in 2019 when I was 17 years old. It features a Bluetooth controller, bright lights, and a super loud horn. I'll also provide a list of all the parts needed and briefly explain how I built it, in case you want to make one yourself.

In 11th grade, I came up with the idea to create my own scoreboard. I presented it to my high school, and they were impressed enough to provide funding for us to build the scoreboard.


This project showcases the construction of a scoreboard featuring a Bluetooth controller, bright lights, and a super loud horn. This project was initially built in 2019 when I was 17 years old. In this readme, I'll provide an overview of the project, list all the necessary parts, and briefly explain how to build it.

## Overview

The Bluetooth scoreboard is designed to provide a visually appealing and interactive way to keep track of scores or game statistics. It incorporates bright lights and a loud horn to enhance the experience. The scoreboard can be controlled wirelessly using a Bluetooth controller, allowing for convenient operation from a distance.

## Parts List

To build the Bluetooth scoreboard, you'll need the following components:

1. Arduino Uno
2. Bluetooth module (e.g., HC-05)
3. LED strips or individual LEDs
4. Speaker or buzzer for the loud horn
5. Power supply (based on the voltage requirements of the LED strips and speaker)
6. Breadboard or PCB for prototyping
7. Jumper wires
8. Resistors (as needed)
9. Enclosure or housing for the scoreboard (optional)

## Building Instructions

1. Connect the Bluetooth module to the Arduino Uno. Refer to the datasheet or documentation of your specific module for pin connections.

2. Wire the LED strips or individual LEDs to the Arduino Uno. Use appropriate resistors to limit the current flow if required. You can create separate sections for different score digits or use a matrix arrangement.

3. Connect the speaker or buzzer to the Arduino Uno. Ensure that it can handle the required voltage and current.

4. Assemble the circuit on a breadboard or PCB. Double-check all the connections and make any necessary adjustments.

5. Install the required libraries for Bluetooth communication and LED control on the Arduino IDE.

6. Write the Arduino code to handle Bluetooth communication, control the LEDs, and trigger the horn. You can customize the code to match your specific scoreboard requirements. Make sure to include comments for clarity.

7. Upload the code to the Arduino Uno using the Arduino IDE.

8. Test the scoreboard by connecting the Bluetooth controller to the Arduino and verifying that the LEDs respond correctly to the controller inputs. Ensure that the horn also functions as intended.

9. Once everything is working as expected, you can consider designing and building an enclosure or housing for the scoreboard to protect the components and enhance its appearance. This step is optional but can add a professional touch to the final product.

10. Document your project, take photos of the different stages, and create a detailed write-up to share your creation with others.

## Acknowledgments

In this project, I drew inspiration from various online resources and tutorials. I would like to acknowledge the open-source community for providing valuable information and support throughout the development process.

## Conclusion

Building a Bluetooth scoreboard can be a fun and rewarding project, combining electronics, programming, and creativity. By following the steps outlined above and using the listed components, you can create your own interactive scoreboard. Feel free to customize and expand upon this project to suit your specific needs and preferences.

If you have any questions or encounter any issues during the build, don't hesitate to reach out for assistance. Happy building!

**Note:** Remember to include any necessary disclaimers or safety precautions in your readme to ensure users take appropriate precautions while building or using the scoreboard.
